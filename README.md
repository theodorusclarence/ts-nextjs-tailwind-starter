### 2. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **pnpm** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`.

### 4. Change defaults

There are some things you need to change including title, urls, favicons, etc.

Find all comments with !STARTERCONF, then follow the guide.

Don't forget to change the package name in package.json

### 5. Commit Message Convention

This starter is using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it is mandatory to use it to commit changes.

## Expansion Pack 📦

This starter is now equipped with an [expansion pack](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack).

You can easily add expansion such as React Hook Form + Components, Storybook, and more just using a single command line.

Check out the [expansion pack repository](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack) for the commands

### App Router Update

Due to App Router update, the expansion pack is currently **outdated**. It will be updated in the future. You can still use them by copy and pasting the files.
